# Pomodoro-Timer-Arduino
Project of pomodoro timer with using Arduino. Project includes wiring and program.

<b> Functions </b> 
- Using display to show left time and kind of work
- By button you can set time of work and break
- After times has passed it goes to the next mode

<b> Notes </b>

I used LiquidCrystal.h library to display everyting on 2x16 LCD. For work with time I used millis() function.
In this project I improved my skills in C language, using libraries and documentation. I learned how to deal with time on Arduino by millis() function instead of delay().
